- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

The export useScrollAnimation was not found in module [project]/Desktop/Dayflow/lib/motion.ts [app-ssr] (ecmascript).
Did you mean to import staggerContainer?
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
